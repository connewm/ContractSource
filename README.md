# Contract Source

> Originally known as LawnSource, extrapolating during development to include all users that contract services

This tool is meant to be a centralized place for contractors to connect with individuals, as a marketplace for services. The functionality includes contact, information, scheduling, and reviewing. All aspects will be able to be handled via the site.

ex. individual would like to schedule lawncare for a time in whiuch they are out of town. Individual browses through lawncare specialists local to them and schedules using live view of specialists availability. Payment is handled online (and not disbursed until service is completed).

The purpose is to connect individuals and contractors who would normally not be able to advertise for themselves (e.g. for individual contractors, or services that are traditionally spread by word of mouth or searching an "online" phone book)
